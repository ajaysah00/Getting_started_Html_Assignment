    <h3><b>Purpose of Comment</b></h3>
    <ul>
        <li><p><b>Debugging:</b>Comments can be used for debugging purposes. Developers can temporarily disable or "comment out" sections of code by wrapping them in comment tags (<!-- and -->). This can be helpful when troubleshooting issues or testing different parts of the code without actually removing any code. It allows for quick and reversible changes during the debugging process.</p></li>
        <li><b>Communication:</b>In collaborative development environments, comments serve as a means of communication among team members. Developers can leave messages, notes, or reminders within the code for their colleagues. This can help coordinate efforts, share insights, or indicate areas that require attention or modification</li>
        <li><b>Preservation of Information:</b>When multiple developers are working on the same HTML document, comments can serve as a means of communication, where developers can leave notes or messages for each other within the code.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>How to use </h3>
    <ul>
